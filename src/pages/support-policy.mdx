    <div class="ps-legal__content">
      <p>Pyroscope will provide following Support Services purchased by Customer for the Software or Services specified
        on an Order Form. The Support Services are intended only for the internal use of Customer (including through its
        contractors and agents) and for the benefit of the Customer and may not be used in support of any third party,
        unless otherwise noted in an Order Form.</p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Support Services are delivered over a specific term as part of a Subscription, typically having a minimum
        one-year term period, and provide expert technical support, technical assistance, Software Updates,
        documentation, and knowledge-base access. This Pyroscope Subscription, with its superior support, service
        offerings, and any applicable licensing, is provided throughout the entire data application and operational
        lifecycle: from development and proof-of-concept, to QA / test, to deployment, and during production.</p>
      <p>Pyroscope offers Support Services to Customer‘s Named Contacts for general guidance and to fix Errors with the
        Software or Cloud Services, if applicable. Pyroscope will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond to
        Customer service requests delivered by a Named Contact to Pyroscope within a target response time, as specified
        below, based on the severity of the service request. The target response time is the time in which Pyroscope
        will make an initial response to the Named Contact, but it does not mean the time by which an Error is fixed or
        in which the assistance is completed. This initial response may include questions seeking to clarify the problem
        or gather information on why the problem occurred, and Pyroscope may be unable to start resolving the problem
        without the additional requested information.</p>
      <h2>Support Services Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>Customer agrees to appoint a specific individual for each Named Contact and will notify Pyroscope in the event
        of any change. Named Contacts will be enabled to use the Pyroscope Support Portal which may not be shared with
        other individuals in the Customer‘s organization. Named Contacts may not automatically forward requests from
        other individuals who are not also Named Contacts. Each contact must have full administrative access to all
        databases, services, files, and file systems, as applicable, that are required for troubleshooting and proper
        operation of the Software or Cloud Services, if applicable. Named Contacts must communicate with Pyroscope in
        English.</p>
      <p>Customer will cooperate with and provide assistance to Pyroscope as Pyroscope may reasonably request in order
        to assist Pyroscope in the performance of Support, including, without limitation, providing all necessary
        assistance and information (according to the formats, templates, and information as specified by Pyroscope) to
        Pyroscope‘s support personnel reasonably required to enable such personnel to determine if a problem is related
        to an Error or is due to some other issue.</p>
      <p>Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Pyroscope functioning test code which reproduces
        and isolates the Error. The test code will have extraneous comments and code removed, will be fully
        self-contained and automated to the extent possible, and will demonstrate the precise Error reported rather than
        other possible problems. The test code must be reproducible on Pyroscope‘s test systems. If Customer finds it
        necessary or expedient to include third-party code or libraries in the test code submitted to Pyroscope,
        Customer is responsible for obtaining permission from the applicable third party for such submission. Pyroscope
        undertakes no support obligations whatsoever with respect to any products other than the Software or Cloud
        Services, if applicable. If Customer does not provide test code which reproduces the problem, Pyroscope may be
        unable to resolve the Error.</p>
      <p>Customer will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Pyroscope with access (via screen share) to the
        extent reasonably necessary to allow Pyroscope to provide the Support Services. If Customer does not provide
        Pyroscope with such access, Pyroscope may be unable to correct the Error.</p>
      <p>In the event that an Error is discovered in the Software, Customer may notify Pyroscope of the Error via a
        Pyroscope-designated support portal (for Severity 1 and 2 Errors) or email, providing the standard problem
        description information as defined by Pyroscope‘s support group. Response delivery is as set forth below.
        Customer must provide Pyroscope with a continually-available engineer who will promptly assist the support and
        development organizations with data gathering, testing, and applying all fixes to the applicable environment for
        Severity Level 1 (Critical) or Severity Level 2 (High) Errors.</p>
      <h2>Release Updates</h2>
      <p>Pyroscope provides Updates to Software as Major Releases, Minor Releases, and Maintenance Releases. Pyroscope
        delivers Support Services in two distinct phases, Full Support and Technical Guidance. All new capabilities and
        product enhancements will be made to the latest Major Release or Minor Release, while Maintenance Releases may
        also be made to older Major Releases and Minor Releases.</p>
