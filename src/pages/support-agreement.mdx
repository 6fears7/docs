    <div class="ps-legal__content">
      <p>PLEASE READ THIS SUPPORT AGREEMENT BEFORE PURCHASING OR USING THE SUPPORT. BY USING OR PURCHASING THE SUPPORT,
        CUSTOMER SIGNIFIES ITS ASSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THEN YOU REPRESENT
        THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT ACCEPT
        THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN CUSTOMER MUST NOT PURCHASE OR USE THE SUPPORT.</p>
      <p>This Support Agreement (“Agreement”) is by and between Pyroscope, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its
        principal place of business at 466 41st st, apt 12, Oakland, CA 94609 (“Pyroscope”) and the
        customer (“Customer”) identified on an order form (“Order Form”) entered into between the parties and is
        effective as of the date Pyroscope signs the Order Form (“Effective Date”).</p>
      <h2><strong>1. Support</strong></h2>
      <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Pyroscope will provide Customer support services (“Support”) for which
        Customer has paid the applicable fees as set forth on an Order Form. Support is only for Customer’s internal use
        for the environment(s) listed in an Order Form. Customer may not use the Support to supply any services to any
        third party or for any environments for which Customer has not paid the applicable fees for support. Pyroscope
        will provide Customer with Support in accordance with the applicable support policy available on its website,
        currently at&nbsp;<a aria-label="/support-policy." class=""
          href="/support-policy">https://pyroscope.io/support-policy</a>.</p>
      <h2><strong>2. Payment</strong></h2>
      <p>Customer will pay to Pyroscope the fees and other compensation set forth in each Order Form. In addition,
        Customer agrees to pay amounts equal to any Federal, state or local sales, use, excise, privilege or other taxes
        or assessments, however designated or levied, relating to this Agreement, exclusive of taxes based on
        Pyroscope’s net income. Customer will pay the invoiced amount in full within ten (10) days of the date of each
        invoice, without deduction, setoff, defense or counterclaim for any reason, unless otherwise stated in the Order
        Form. All payments are nonrefundable. Customer will pay interest, at a rate equal to one percent (1%) per month
        on any undisputed amount that remains unpaid thirty (30) days after the date of the invoice. Pyroscope shall
        have the right to suspend the provision of Support if any invoice remains unpaid thirty (30) days after the date
        of the invoice.</p>
      <h2><strong>3. Ownership</strong></h2>
      <p>Customer acknowledges that as part of performing the Support, Pyroscope personnel may utilize proprietary
        software, methodologies, tools, specifications, drawings, sketches, models, samples, records, documentation,
        works of authorship or creative works, ideas, knowledge, data or other materials which have been originated or
        developed by the personnel of Pyroscope or its Affiliates or by third parties under contract to Pyroscope to
        develop same, or which have been purchased by, or licensed to, Pyroscope (collectively, “Pyroscope Proprietary
        Intellectual Property”). Pyroscope Proprietary Intellectual Property includes, but is not limited to, any new or
        improved methodologies or tools developed by Pyroscope during the provision of Support under this Agreement.
        Customer agrees that Pyroscope Proprietary Intellectual Property is the sole property of Pyroscope (or its
        licensor) and that Pyroscope (or its licensor) will at all times retain sole and exclusive title to and
        ownership thereof. Except as expressly provided above, nothing contained in this Agreement or otherwise will be
        construed to grant to Customer any right, title, license or other interest in, to or under any Pyroscope
        Proprietary Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding the above, Customer agrees that Pyroscope, its employees and
        agents will be free to use and employ their general skills, know-how, and expertise, and to use, disclose, and
        employ any generalized ideas, concepts, know-how, methods, techniques or skills gained or learned during the
        course of any Support performed under this Agreement.</p>
      <h2><strong>4. Confidential Information</strong></h2>
      <p>The term “Confidential Information” will mean any and all information or proprietary materials (in every form
        and media) not generally known in the relevant trade or industry and which has been or is hereafter disclosed or
        made available by either party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other (the “Receiving Party”) in connection with
        the efforts contemplated under this Agreement, including (i) all trade secrets, (ii) existing or contemplated
        products, services, designs, technology, processes, technical data, engineering, techniques, methodologies and
        concepts and any related information, and (iii) information relating to business plans, sales or marketing
        methods and customer lists or requirements. For a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of the
        applicable Confidential Information, Customer and Pyroscope will each (i) hold the Confidential Information of
        the other in trust and confidence and avoid the disclosure or release thereof to any other person or entity by
        using the same degree of care as it uses to avoid unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination of its own
        confidential information of a similar nature, but not less than reasonable care, and (ii) not use the
        Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose whatsoever except as expressly contemplated under
        this Agreement or any Order Form; provided that, to the extent the Confidential Information constitutes a trade
        secret under law, the Receiving Party agrees to protect such information for so long as it qualifies as a trade
        secret under applicable law. Each party will disclose the Confidential Information of the other only to those of
        its employees and contractors having a need to know such Confidential Information and will take all reasonable
        precautions to ensure that such employees and contractors comply with the provisions of this section. Each party
        shall be liable for all violations of this Agreement by its employees and contractors. The obligations of either
        party under this section will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate (i) was in its
        possession at the time of disclosure and without restriction as to confidentiality, (ii) at the time of
        disclosure is generally available to the public or after disclosure becomes generally available to the public
        through no breach of agreement or other wrongful act by the Receiving Party, (iii) has been received from a
        third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of agreement by the Receiving Party, or (iv) is
        independently developed by the Receiving Party without regard to the Confidential Information of the other
        party. In addition, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information as required to comply with binding
        orders of governmental entities that have jurisdiction over it; provided that the Receiving Party gives the
        Disclosing Party reasonable written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other
        appropriate remedy, discloses only such Confidential Information as is required by the governmental entity, and
        uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information
        disclosed.</p>
      <h2><strong>5. Warranty and Liability</strong></h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong>5.1 Limited Warranty.</strong> Pyroscope warrants the following for a period of thirty (30) days
          following delivery (the “Warranty Period”): the applicable Support rendered under this Agreement will be
          performed by qualified personnel and the Support performed will substantially conform to any applicable
          requirements set forth in the Order Form.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2 Remedies.</strong> Pyroscope does not warrant that the Support will be provided timely, secure,
          uninterrupted or error-free, provided that Pyroscope will remain obligated pursuant to this Section. Pyroscope
          makes no warranty that Support will meet users’ expectations or requirements. If any Support fails to conform
          to the foregoing warranty in any material respect, the sole and exclusive remedy of Customer will be for
          Pyroscope, at its expense, to promptly use commercially reasonable efforts to cure or correct such failure.
          The foregoing warranty is expressly conditioned upon (i) Customer providing Pyroscope with prompt written
          notice of any claim thereunder prior to the expiration of the applicable Warranty Period, which written notice
          must identify with particularity the non-conformity; and (ii) Customer’s full cooperation with Pyroscope in
          all reasonable respects relating thereto.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3 Disclaimer.</strong> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 5.1, Pyroscope DOES NOT MAKE OR GIVE
          ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, WHETHER SUCH REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR CONDITION
          BE EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT
          OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR CONDITION FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR
          USAGE OF TRADE.</p>
      </div>
      <h2><strong>6. EMPLOYEES</strong></h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong>6.1 No Employee Relationship.</strong> Pyroscope’s employees are not and will not be deemed to be
          employees of Customer. Pyroscope will be solely responsible for the payment of all compensation to its
          employees, including provisions for employment taxes, workmen’s compensation and any similar taxes associated
          with employment of Pyroscope’s personnel. Pyroscope’s employees will not be entitled to any benefits paid or
          made available by Customer to its employees.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2 Subcontractors.</strong> Pyroscope may engage third parties to furnish services in connection
          with the Support, provided that such third parties have executed appropriate confidentiality agreements with
          Pyroscope. In addition, Support may be performed by Affiliates of Pyroscope. No engagement of a subcontractor
          will relieve Pyroscope from any of its obligations under this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>6.3 Non-Solicitation.</strong> Customer may not hire, or directly or indirectly solicit or employ,
          any employee of Pyroscope for twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement; provided, however,
          that nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent Customer from hiring any such employee who responds to a
          general hiring program conducted in the ordinary course of business or who approaches Customer on a wholly
          unsolicited basis.</p>
      </div>
      <h2><strong>7. Term and Termination</strong></h2>
      <p>The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain and continue in effect, unless
        sooner terminated as provided under this Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated in whole or in part by
        either party (the “Non-Breaching Party”) upon written notice to the other party if any of the following events
        occur by or with respect to such other party (the “Breaching Party”): (i) the Breaching Party commits a material
        breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days
        after receipt of written notice of such breach or fails to reach an agreement with the Non-Breaching Party
        regarding the cure thereof; or (ii) any insolvency of the Breaching Party, any filing of a petition in
        bankruptcy by or against the Breaching Party, any appointment of a receiver for the Breaching Party, or any
        assignment for the benefit of the Breaching Party’s creditors. Upon termination, Pyroscope will be entitled to
        recover payment for all Support rendered through the date of termination. In the event of termination or upon
        expiration of this Agreement, Sections 2, 3, 4, 5.3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 will survive and continue in full force and
        effect.</p>
      <h2><strong>8. Limitation of Liability</strong></h2>
      <p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE WILL Pyroscope BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
        DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST REVENUE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF INCOME OR LOSS OF BUSINESS
        ADVANTAGE), WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, EVEN IF it HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO
        EVENT WILL Pyroscope’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
        DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
        WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER EITHER PARTY’S REMEDIES HEREUNDER ARE DETERMINED TO
        HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
      <h2><strong>9. General Provisions</strong></h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.1</strong> Neither party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights
          or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
          withheld, and any such assignment in violation of this Section shall be void, except that (i) either party may
          assign this Agreement or rights granted hereunder to an Affiliate without the consent of the other party and
          (ii) the transfer of this Agreement or rights granted hereunder to a successor entity in the event of a
          merger, corporate reorganization, or acquisition shall not constitute an assignment for purposes of this
          Section. Affiliate means an entity that a party, directly or indirectly, controls, an entity that controls a
          party or an entity that is under common control with a party. For purposes of this provision, control means
          ownership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting shares of the entity.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.2</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
          parties concerning the subject matter hereof. Purchase orders will be for the sole purpose of defining
          quantities, prices and describing the Support to be provided under this Agreement and to this extent only are
          incorporated as a part of this Agreement and all other terms in purchase orders are rejected. This Agreement
          supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals and agreements between the parties relating to
          the subject matter hereof. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be
          effective unless in writing and signed by both parties, except as expressly permitted in Section 9.3.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.3</strong> Pyroscope reserves the right to alter the terms of this
          Agreement at any time. Customer agrees to review the latest version of the Agreement on Pyroscope’s website
          periodically to remain aware of any modifications to the Agreement about which Customer is not notified by
          Pyroscope. The Agreement available on the website will be dated so as to make clear what version is currently
          in force. Any use of Support after alteration of the Agreement will constitute acceptance by Customer of such
          changes. Customer’s sole remedy should Customer not agree with the altered Agreement shall be to cease
          Customer’s use of Support and to comply with Customer’s termination obligations outlined in Section 7 of this
          Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.4</strong> Either Party may identify the other as a user or customer,
          as applicable, and may use the other’s name and logo in Customer or vendor lists, press releases, blog posts,
          advertisements, and on their respective websites.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.5</strong> This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of
          California, without reference to the principles of conflicts of law. The parties acknowledge and agree that this
          Agreement relates solely to the performance of services (not the sale of goods) and, accordingly, will not be
          governed by the Uniform Commercial Code of any State having jurisdiction. In addition, the provisions of the
          Uniform Computerized Information Transaction Act and United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
          International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement. All Support services are Commercial Items as
          that term is defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 C.F.R. 2.101.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.6</strong> The parties will attempt to resolve any dispute related to
          this Agreement informally, initially through their respective management, and then by non-binding mediation in
          Alameda County, California. Any litigation related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal
          courts located in Alameda County, California, and only in those courts and each party irrevocably waives any
          objections to such venue. All written notices must be in writing and will be effective three (3) days after
          the date sent to the addresses shown on the applicable Order Form.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.7</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
          unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect and such provision will be enforced
          to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and will be reformed to the extent
          necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">9.8</strong> No waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any
          actions or failures to enforce rights under this Agreement. Neither party will be liable to the other for any
          delay or failure to perform due to causes beyond its reasonable control (excluding payment of monies due).
          Unless otherwise specifically stated, the terms of this Agreement are intended to be and are solely for the
          benefit of Pyroscope and Customer and do not create any right in favor of any third party.</p>
