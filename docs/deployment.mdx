## System requirements

As a rule of thumb, if you want to profile your whole cloud infrastructure, expect to spend about 1% of your cloud budget on Pyroscope server.

| Resource        | More of resource equals                                                            |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU             | higher write bandwidth                                                             |
| RAM             | higher write bandwidth, support for more individual apps                           |
| Disk throughput | higher write bandwidth                                                             |
| Disk Space      | higher data retention (ability to store profiling data for longer periods of time) |


## Networking requirements

These are the ports used by pyroscope server. Make sure you allow access to these ports from the outside:

| Port      | Description                                       |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| TCP :4040 | HTTP API, used for both data ingestion and web UI |

Currently there's no authentication mechanism in pyroscope. Possible workarounds are:
* use other access control solutions, for example [OAuth2 Proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) (recommended)
* use a reverse proxy with Basic Authentication (e.g nginx)
* only allow access from select IPs
* set up an ssh tunnel, e.g `ssh <user>@<remote-address> -L 4040:127.0.0.1:4040 -N`
