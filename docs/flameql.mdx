This document introduces FlameQL, the Pyroscope query language that enables users exploring profiling data.

## Concepts

### Data model

Pyroscope stores profiling data associated with applications. An application may have multiple different profile types,
for example: `cpu`, `alloc_space`, `inuse_space`, etc. Typically, profilers report data collected through sampling of a
program, so each sample describes a program call stack, and a number or value of samples collected at a location, e.g.
source file/line or function name.

Every sample is also described by metadata which allow users querying and aggregating collected profiling data.
In pyroscope, we use **tags** to set arbitrary key-values to the collected samples. If you are familiar with Prometheus,
you may think of it as **labels**. Tags are an optional part of the data structure; they become very useful when it
comes to querying.

:::note
To ensure the best performance it's recommended to keep the number of unique tag values low. In particular, consider
avoiding use of identifiers and request-scoped values.

#### Notation

Given an application name, and a tag set, the fully qualified name is identified using this notation:
```
<application_name>[{[<tag_key>=<tag_value>[,<tag_key>=<tag_value>]]}]
```

For example, the fully qualified name for CPU profile of `my-awesome-app` application instance tagged with
`region us-west-1` and `env staging` takes the following form:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{env=staging,region=us-west-1}
```

:::note
When ingesting data, **Pyroscope Agent** adds a name suffix specifying the profile type: `<application_name>.<profile_type>`.
:::

##### Constraints

Tag keys may contain ASCII letters, digits, and `_`.
Application name may contain ASCII letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `.`.

###### Reserved tag keys

The following keys are reserved for internal use and should not be used:
- `__name__`

### Query expression language

Queries in FlameQL are expressed as the following:

```
<application_name>[{[<tag_matcher>[,<tag_matcher>]]}]
```

In the simplest form, only application name is specified. For example, consider the simplest query:
```
my.awesome.app
```

Such a query will return aggregated data for all the instances of `my.awesome.app`. As of now, only `sum` aggregation
is available - the resulting profile will be a merge of all the found profiles.

It is possible to filter instances to aggregate by appending a comma separated list of tag matchers in curly braces
(`{}`) â€“ tag matchers are expressions which specify conditions to include or exclude dimensions based on the
associated tags.

```
<tag_key><operator>"<tag_value>"
```

Supported operators:
 - `=` a tag value must be exactly equal to the provided string.
 - `=~` a tag value must regex-match the provided string.
 - `!=` a tag value must not be equal to the provided string.
 - `!~` a tag value must not regex-match the provided string.

It is possible to have multiple matchers for the same tag. Regular expressions use RE2 syntax.

#### Examples

All application instances regardless of the tags:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu
```

All application instances regardless of the tags:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{}
```

Application instances tagged with `env=staging`:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{env="staging"}
```

Application instances **NOT** tagged with `env=staging`:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{env!="staging"}
```

Application instances tagged with `env=staging` **AND** `region=us-west-1`:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{env="staging",region="us-west-1"}
```

Application instances **NOT** tagged with `env=staging` **AND** have `region` tag value equal to `us-west-1` **OR** `eu-west-1`:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{env!="staging",region=~"us-west-1|eu-west-1"}
```

Application instances with tag `region` which begins with `us` **AND** **NOT** contains `west`:
```
my.awesome.app.cpu{region=~"us.*",region!~".*west.*"}
```
