Pyroscope identifies performance issues in your application by continuously profiling the code.

If you've never used a profiler before, then welcome!

If you are familiar with profiling and flame graphs, then you'll be happy to know that Pyroscope:
- Has low CPU overhead thanks to sampling profiler technology
- Can store years of profiling data down to 10 second granularity
- Efficient compression, low disk space requirements

There are two main components that allow Pyroscope to run smoothly and quickly:

## Pyroscope Agent

Pyroscope agent wraps around your Python, Ruby, or Go application and polls the stacktrace 100 times per second to calculate which functions are consuming CPU.

## Pyroscope Server

Pyroscope Agent records and aggregates what your application has been doing, then sends that data to the Pyroscope Server over port `:4040` to be processed, aggregated, and stored for speedy queries of any time range. Later you can look at the profiling data and make queries across any time range for example:
- all of 2020
- that one day last month when the website was slow
- that time you deployed on a Friday night and messed up everything without knowing why

Check out our [Demo Page](https://demo.pyroscope.io/) and select any time range to see how quickly Pyroscope works!
