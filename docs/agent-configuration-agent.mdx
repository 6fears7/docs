### `pyroscope agent`

The command continuously tracks configured `targets` and attaches profilers to them. This command is primarily supposed
to be run in the context of a service manager such as systemd or Windows Service Control Manager, or when the target
application is not known in advance.

:::note
`pyroscope agent` command is only supported on Windows.

<!-- /generate-sample-config -->

### Configuration file options

<!-- generate-sample-config:agent:yaml -->
```yaml
---
# Log file path.
log-file-path: ""

# Log level: debug|info|warn|error.
log-level: "info"

# Disables logging from pyroscope.
no-logging: "false"

# Address of the pyroscope server.
server-address: "http://localhost:4040"

# Authorization token used to upload profiling data.
auth-token: ""

# Number of upload threads.
upstream-threads: "4"

# Profile upload timeout.
upstream-request-timeout: "10s"

# List of targets to be profiled.
targets: []

# Tag key value pairs.
tags: {}

```
<!-- /generate-sample-config -->

#### Targets

Targets describe applications to be profiled. At this moment the only supported type is `system service`.

Note that `targets` can not be specified with command line arguments or environment variables.

<!-- generate-sample-config:target:yaml -->
```yaml
---
# Name of the system service to be profiled.
service-name: ""

# Name of the profiler you want to use. Supported ones are: pyspy, rbspy, phpspy, dotnetspy, ebpfspy.
spy-name: ""

# Application name used when uploading profiling data.
application-name: ""

# Sample rate for the profiler in Hz. 100 means reading 100 times per second.
sample-rate: "100"

# Makes pyroscope keep track of and profile subprocesses of the main process.
detect-subprocesses: "true"

# Enables blocking mode for pyspy.
pyspy-blocking: "false"

# Enables blocking mode for rbspy.
rbspy-blocking: "false"

```
<!-- /generate-sample-config -->

:::note
**application-name** may be specified in the fully qualified notation as described in [the specification](/docs/flameql#notation). For example:
```
my.awesome.app{env=staging,region=us-west-1}
```
Explicitly specified tags take precedence.
:::

### Environment variables

Environment variables **MUST** have `PYROSCOPE_` prefix and be in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` format, for example:
```shell
PYROSCOPE_APPLICATION_NAME=my.awesome.app
```

### Example

This example shows how a system service with name `MyService` may be profiled:

```yaml
---
log-level: "debug"
server-address: http://pyroscope-server:4040
targets:
 - application-name: my.dotnet.svc
   spy-name: dotnetspy
   service-name: MyService
```
