Pyroscope Server offers a way to export values of a particular stack trace sample from your profiles as a Prometheus
metric. This can be very useful if you already know a spot in your code that might be causing a problem, and you want
to keep track of it.

Exported metrics are of [counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter) type and are available
at `/exported-metrics` endpoint. Samples of CPU time are counted in seconds based on the sample period, samples of other
types are represented as-is:

| Profile type     | Units   | Aggregation |
|:-----------------|:--------|:------------|
| `cpu`            | seconds | sum         |
| `inuse_objects`  | objects | sum         |
| `alloc_objects`  | objects | sum         |
| `inuse_space`    | bytes   | avg         |
| `alloc_space`    | bytes   | avg         |

Metric export rules can be specified in the server configuration file:
```yaml
metrics-export-rules: {}
```

`metrics-export-rules` is a map of rules for exporting metrics where the key is a unique valid prometheus metric name.
A rule is defined as follows:

<!-- generate-sample-config:export-rule:yaml -->
```yaml
---
# Expression in FlameQL syntax to be evaluated against samples.
expr: ""

# Tree node filter expression. Should be either 'total' or a valid RE2 regexp.
node: ""

# List of tags to be used for aggregation. The tags are exported as prometheus labels.
group_by: []
```
<!-- /generate-sample-config -->

For example, let's define a metric that shows how many sampled values of CPU time have been captured for
`main;slowFunction` calls of `app.name` application in `staging` environment:
```yaml
app_name_expensive_call:
  expr: 'app.name.cpu{env="staging"}'
  node: "main;slowFunction"
  labels:
   - "version"
```

:::note
When ingesting data, **Pyroscope Agent** adds a name suffix specifying the profile type: `<application_name>.<profile_type>`.
:::

Node filter is a regular expression applied to sampled stack traces, frames are delimited by semicolon. Any call that
includes `main;slowFunction` in its stack trace will match the rule and will be added to the metric value. If the sample
has a `version` tag attached, it will be preserved as a label of the exported metric, and any other tag will be
omitted â€“ pretty much like `GROUP BY` statement in SQL.

Similarly, a metric for the whole application can be configured:

```yaml
app_name_total:
  expr: "app.name.cpu"
  node: "total"
```

## Example

Let's configure some metrics to demonstrate how filtering and aggregation works:
 - `a_simple_app_total` counts application samples.
 - `a_simple_app_slow_env_prod` counts `slowFunction` samples with `env=prod` tag.
 - `a_simple_app_slow_env` counts `slowFunction` samples broken down by `env` tag.

You can find [sample program](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/blob/main/examples/golang/main.go) in the
Pyroscope repository. We will run two instances: one with `env=prod` tag and another one with `env=staging`.

```yaml
metrics-export-rules:
  a_simple_app_total:
    expr: simple.golang.app.cpu

  a_simple_app_slow_env_prod:
    expr: simple.golang.app.cpu{env="prod"}
    node: slowFunction

  a_simple_app_slow_env:
    expr: simple.golang.app.cpu
    node: slowFunction
    labels:
      - "env"
```

After some time you should see exported metrics at `/exported-metrics` endpoint:
```
a_simple_app_slow_env_prod 1260
a_simple_app_slow_env{env="staging"} 1701
a_simple_app_slow_env{env="prod"} 1260
a_simple_app_total 3768
```

You can see how exporting works using the [example](https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope/tree/main/examples/metrics-export)
in the pyroscope repository. The example also demonstrates how to query the resulting metrics.
